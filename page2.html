                             <h2>What is a Mobile Computing System?</h2>
<Li>Mobile Computing System is a distributed system, which is connected via a
wireless network for communication. The clients or the nodes possess mobility and
the ability to provide computing at anytime, anywhere.</Li>
                          <h2>Main Components of a Mobile Computing System:-</h2>
<h2>-Mobile Hardware</h2>
<Li>Mobile Hardware is a small and portable computing device with the ability to retrieve
and process data. Smartphones, handheld and wearable devices fall under mobile
hardware. These devices typically have an Operating System (OS) embedded in them
and able to run application software on top of it. These devices are equipped with
sensors, full-duplex data transmission and have the ability to operate on wireless
networks such as IR, WiFi, and Bluetooth.</Li>

<h2>-Mobile Software</h2>
<Li>Mobile Software is the software program which is developed specifically to be run on
mobile hardware. This is usually the operating system in mobile devices. These
operating systems provide features such as touchscreen, cellular connectivity,
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS mobile navigation, camera, video camera, speech recognition,
voice recorder, music player, near field communication and sensors. The device
sensors and other hardware components can be accessed via the OS</Li>
<h2>-Mobile Communication</h2>
<Li>Mobile Communication refers to the exchange of data and voice using existing
wireless networks. The data being transferred are the applications including File
Transfer (FT), the interconnection between Wide-Area-Networks (WAN), facsimile
(fax), electronic mail, access to the internet and the World Wide Web. The wireless
networks utilized in communication are IR, Bluetooth, W-LANs, Cellular, W-Packet
Data networks and satellite communication system. It is the mobile communication
infrastructure which takes care of seamless and reliable communication between
mobile devices.

          <h2>* Principles of Mobile Computing :-</h2>
<h2>Portability</h2>
<Li>Devices/nodes connected within the mobile computing system should facilitate
mobility. These devices may have limited device capabilities and limited power
supply, but should have a sufficient processing capability and physical portability to
operate in a movable environment.</Li>
<h2>Connectivity</h2>
<Li>This defines the Quality of Service (QoS) of the network connectivity. In a mobile
computing system, the network availability is expected to be maintained at a high
level with the minimal amount of lag/downtime without being affected by the
mobility of the connected nodes.</Li>
<h2>Interactivity</h2>
<Li>The nodes belonging to a mobile computing system are connected with one another to
communicate and collaborate through active transactions of data. </Li>
<h2>Individuality</h2>
<Li>A portable device or a mobile node connected to a mobile network often denote an
individual; a mobile computing system should be able to adopt the technology to cater
the individual needs and also to obtain contextual information of each node.</Li>

                                      <h2>* Advantages and Disadvantages of Mobile Computing Technology</h2>
