            <h2> Advantage and Disadvantage of Mobile Computing </h2> 
    <h2>Advantage of Mobile Computing :</h2>
<Li>1. Increasing productivity — Mobile devices can be used in the field of various
instruments, so reducing time and cost for customers and themselves.</Li> 

<Li>2. Entertainment — For entertainment purposes, mobile devices can be used for both
people and customers for personal and even presentations.</Li>

<Li>3. Portability — The main advantages of this, you are not bound to one Zone . It help
to access any wireless devices without place boundation.</Li>

<Li>4. Cloud Computing — This service is available to save documents on online servers
and whenever you make a connection to the Internet, they are able to
access them at anytime and anywhere and these files can be used for many mobile
devices or even That can also access on PC.</Li> 
  
            <h2>Disadvantage of Mobile Computing :</h2> 
<Li> Battery consumption hindrance </Li>

<Li> Interference is persisted in shielding</Li>

<Li> Inefficient bandwidth in transmission</Li>

<Li> Connection losses over entire network</Li>

<Li> Network stability </Li>

<Li> Interoperability problem. </Li> 

<Li> Protection constraints </Li> 
 
           <h2>Limitations of Mobile Computing</h2>

 <Li> Resource constraints: Battery .</Li> 

<Li> Interference: Radio transmission cannot be protected against interference
using shielding and result in higher loss rates for transmitted data or higher bit
error rates respectively. </Li> 

<Li> Bandwidth: Although they are continuously increasing, transmission rates are
still very low for wireless devices compared to desktop systems. Researchers
look for more efficient communication protocols with low overhead. </Li> 

<Li> Dynamic changes in communication environment: variations in signal power
within a region, thus link delays and connection losses. </Li>

<Li> Network Issues: discovery of the connection-service to destination and
connection stability.</Li>

<Li> Interoperability issues: the varying protocol standards </Li>
   
              <h2>Applications : Mobile Computing </h2>
